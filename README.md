## ATM and Banking SYSTEM
### AIM: 
To study the problem statement, SRS document and draw all the UML diagrams of ATM
System.
### SRS (Procedure):

Problem Definition:
The ATM and Banking System allows users to perform basic banking operations such as balance inquiry, cash withdrawal, deposit, and fund transfer using an ATM interface connected to a central banking database.

Objective:
To design a system that provides secure and efficient ATM operations integrated with a bank’s server for real-time transaction processing.

Functional Requirements:

The system should allow user authentication using a card number and PIN.

The system should enable the user to check account balance.

The system should allow users to withdraw and deposit cash.

The system should enable fund transfers between accounts.

The system should generate a receipt after each transaction.

Non-Functional Requirements:

Security: User PINs and transactions should be encrypted.

Performance: Transaction processing time should be minimal.

Reliability: The system must ensure accurate and consistent data updates.

Usability: The user interface should be simple and user-friendly.

Availability: The system should be operational 24/7.

System Components:

User Interface (ATM Machine): For user interaction.

Bank Server: Maintains account details and verifies transactions.

Database: Stores customer data, account balance, and transaction logs.

System Design Steps:

Identify actors and use cases (customer, bank server, admin).

Draw UML diagrams:

Use Case Diagram

Class Diagram

Sequence Diagram

Activity Diagram

Collaboration Diagram

Deployment Diagram

Validate each use case for correctness and completeness.
